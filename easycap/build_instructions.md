The transformation from Emotiv to Emocap is very simple. There are 5 basic steps: Disassembling the Emotiv, assembling the EASY CAP, soldering the wires of the Emotiv to one side of a 16pin connector, crimping the wires of the electrodes and inserting them into the other side of the 16 pin connector, and modifying a plastic box to hold everything.

1)  Remove the black plastic sticker from the inside surface of the Emotiv. Pry away the plastic piece with the Emotiv logo on both sides of the band.

2)  Remove the 4 screws and remove the electronics from the black band pictured below

3)	Remove the sticker covering the wires leading to the electrodes and note the layout of the wires. Our emotiv was wired like this:

The numbers above each location are the connector pin numbers that we soldered the wire for the position to. E.g. The wire for the Emotiv position O2 is soldered to pin 16.

4)	Cut the wires leading to the electrodes and feed the wires through the plastic piece to remove it.

5)	Strip and solder the wires  to the connector noting the locations of the wires for each EEG position. The two reference wires for each side are soldered to the same pin.

6)  Install the EASY CAP electrodes in the EASY CAP and label each leadwire with the EEG position it corresponds to.

7)	Mark each label with the pin number of the connector pin that you will crimp the leadwires to.

The diagram above shows the wiring patten that we used. Note that there are only 2 reference electrodes while the Emotiv system had 4. Also note that the anterior positions of the EASY CAP are wired to the right Emotiv positions via even numbered pins and the posterior positions of the Easy cap are wired to the left Emotiv positions via odd numbered pins. The colors correspond to the color of the Emotiv wire that each electrode connects to. 

8)	Crimp a crimp sleeve onto each leadwire and insert the crimp sleeves into the connector.

9)	Modify a plastic box to hold the Emotiv hardware and allow access to the switch and micro USB port. Use a small bag or pouch to hold the box at the back of your emocap

10)	Connect the cap to the Emotiv and test your system.
